# java-asm-obfuscator (jasmo)
Obfuscates compiled java code to make it harder to reverse engineer.

```text
usage: java -jar jasmo.jar <src> <dest> [-c <arg>] [-h] [-k <arg>] [-p <arg>] [-v]
 -c,--cfn <arg>       Enable 'crazy fucking names' and set name length (large names == large output size)
 -h,--help            Print help message
 -k,--keep <arg>      Don't rename this class
 -p,--package <arg>   Move obfuscated classes to this package
 -v,--verbose         Increase verbosity
```
 
Current Obfuscators:
-

<dl>
    <dt>Shuffle Members<br></dt>
    <dd>Shuffles the order of classes, methods, fields, annotations, interfaces, exceptions etc</dd>
    <dt>Inline Accessors<br></dt>
    <dd>Removes get/set methods, replacing them with direct field access</dd>
    <dt>Remove Debug Information</dt>
    <dd>Removes debugging information left by the compiler such as variable names and line numbers</dd>
    <dt>Scramble Classes</dt>
    <dd>Renames classes, optionally skipping classes provided by the --keep option, all classes are moved to the package provided by the --package option (otherwise to the base package)</dd>
    <dt>Scramble Fields</dt>
    <dd>Renames fields</dd>
    <dt>Scramble Methods</dt>
    <dd>Renames methods, skipping those that are required not to be (such as main), native or are overrides of external libraries (Libraries should be included in java class path).</dd>
    <dt>Scramble Strings</dt>
    <dd>Replaces string constants with an "unscramble" method</dd>
</dl>

***

The project includes two test scripts in the 'test/' directory
* The first test obfuscates the compiled output of it's self. (<b>Make sure that target/java-asm-obfuscator-*.jar has execution permission</b>)
* The second test obfuscates the compiled output of it's self with the obfuscated output generated by the first test; to make sure that the obfuscated version is functional. (<b>Make sure that target/result.jar has execution permission</b>)

For analyzing obfuscated code I suggest using [https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer](url), it merges many java reverse engineering tools into one and includes many useful features.
